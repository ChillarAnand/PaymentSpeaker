### Payment Speaker

An android app to announce the payments received by reading incoming SMS.


### Why This App?

Consider a juice shop owner who setup a UPI(PayTM, GPay, PhonePhe, BHIM etc) merchant account. Now whenever a customer makes a payment, he has to stop his work and check his phone to verify the completed payment.

Instead of that, this app will announce the payment on speaker as soon as payment is made. This improves productivity of the merchants by saving their time.
